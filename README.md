# SelectiveGeneration
Code base for [Mei et al. NAACL 2016 paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1509.00838/)

## This codebase is still under-tested, so I share my original (uncleaned) code and data through this Google drive: 
https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0BwqmV0EcoUc8OHpLd3NaU19Hb0E?usp=sharing 

## Dependencies
* [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/) - Anaconda includes all the Python-related dependencies
* [Theano](http://deeplearning.net/software/theano/) - Computational graphs are built on Theano
* [NLTK](http://www.nltk.org/) - Natural Language Toolkit
* [JPype](http://jpype.sourceforge.net/) - Call Java in Python
* [JDK](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads) - Java Development Toolkit
* [ArgParse](https://docs.python.org/2/howto/argparse.html) - Command line parsing in Python

## Instructions
Here are the instructions to use the code base.

### Prepare Data
Creat a folder called 'data' and copy data files (to be added) to it. 

### Prepare Eval Code
Creat a folder called 'dist'. 

Download and compile the Java code from [Gabor Angeli's 2010 EMNLP paper](http://cs.stanford.edu/~angeli/). 

Copy the generation.jar file to the dist folder.

### Train Models
To train the model with options, use the command line 
```
python train_models.py --options
```
For the details of options, please check
```
python train_models.py --help
```

### Test Models
Choose a model to evaluate on dev or test set, with the command line:
```
python test_models.py --options
```
For the details of options, please check
```
python test_models.py --help
```
